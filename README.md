To use LIRI in a Terminal/BASH window, you must have node.js installed. Then run liri.js with node and give it one of the following commands
   * `concert-this`
   * `spotify-this-song`
   * `movie-this`
   * `do-what-it-says`
   
(your syntax should looke like `node liri.js spotify-this-song sound of silence` in order to get the correct result)
